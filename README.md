# Chinese-checkers
Client-server game of Chinese checkers.

Rules:
Board is six-pointed star. Each triangular
star point has ten holes (four holes per side) for a player’s pieces. The board’s hexagonal  interior has
five holes on each side.

Each player must have an opponent opposite, so there can only be
two, three, four, or six players. Each player has 10 marbles. Every player tries to put his marbles on the
opposite arm of the star.

Movement
Play goes clockwise around the board. A player moves one piece one space in any direction.
Pieces can jump other pieces occupying adjacent spaces, including the pieces of the player taking a turn.
There must be an open space on the other side of the piece you are jumping. If not jumping, only one space
per move is permitted. A player may jump as many pieces as are available – the player’s turn ends when there
are no more pieces to jump. Jumped pieces are not removed from the board. When a player’s piece moves into
the opposite point of the star, it may not leave, but can be moved within the star. Pieces may move into and 
out of any of the star points not in use or belonging to a non-opponent.

Winning
The player who moves all ten pieces into the opposite point of the star is the game winner.

Game can by played by 2, 3, 4 or 6 players. Each player can be a human or computer player.
